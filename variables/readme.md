## Variables in Swift

<p>In Swift we can declare variables in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.var=>A variables whicg can be mutable in the sense we can modify their value.</li>
<li>2.let=>A variables which cannot be modified after initialization.</li>
</ul>

### Examples


```
var name = "John
print(name) // John
```
